        <p>Every human being needs to have access to basic services in a daily basis, just to live a "normal life".</p>
        <p>However, in Venezuela, getting such access gets harder every time. Venezuelans suffer because of the lack, or even inexistence of these.</p>
        <p>In this section we talk about the following basic services in Venezuela:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="#electricity">Electricity</a></li>
            <li><a href="#water">Water</a></li>
            <li><a href="#cookingGas">Cooking gas</a></li>
        </ul><br>
        <h2 id="electricity">Electricity deficit and blackouts</h2><br>
        <p>For several years an important part of the country have suffered constant blackouts. Millions of Venezuelans have been condemned to live in the dark
        for hours every single day.</p>
        <p>This electricity deficit has caused, among other terrible consequences, the loss of millions of home appliances, medical supplies and food.</p>
        <p>Reuters Graphics made a great report regarding this matter, called <a href="https://graphics.reuters.com/VENEZUELA-POWER/0100B0DC0TS/index.html"
        target="_blank">"A nation left in the dark".</a> This is an extract from that report:</p>
        <p><span class="italic bold">"Oil exports, transport and communications were interrupted and the power outages also left millions of people
        scrambling to find water and food, with hospitals struggling to keep equipment operating"</span>.</p>
        <p>And the reasons? Well, recall that the Electricity industry was <a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2007-feb-09-fg-briefs19.4-story.html" target="_blank">nationalized</a>.</p><br>
        <h2 id="water">Water shortage</h2><br>

        <div>
            <p><span class="italic">"Despite ranking as one of the world’s top 15 countries in renewable fresh water resources, nearly 8 out of 10 Venezuelans do not have continuous access
            to clean drinking water and basic sanitation. For most citizens, the water they sporadically consume is of dubious quality or not drinkable. Clean water in
            Venezuela has become a luxury, and even with price controls set in place, a bottle of water is about $3, a significant portion of the country’s minimum
            wage of approximately $8 a month"</span>.</p>
            <p>The previous text was extracted from a report made by the Center for Strategic & International Studies (CSIS), called
            <a href="https://www.csis.org/analysis/unraveling-water-crisis-venezuela" target="_blank">Unraveling the Water Crisis in Venezuela</a>, on December 10, 2019.</p>
            <p>In the short video to the right, a Venezuelan woman talks to BBC about this crisis:</p>
        </div><br>
        <h2 id="cookingGas">Cooking gas shortage</h2><br>
        <iframe width="510" height="265" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CeWX2fpQQWk" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen class="floatLeft rightMargin"></iframe>
        <p>Even when Venezuela has the world's largest oil reserves, people in that country have suffered several periods of chronic gas shortage during the last decade.</p>
        <p>During those periods, Venezuelans have been forced to either cook with firewood or plastic, or spend several hours in really, really long queues, just to buy a single cooking gas cylinder.</p>
        <p>You can watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spsI3X6QVfg" target="_blank">this report</a> from "Univision Noticias", which unfortunalety is completely in Spanish (since it was not possible
        to find a similar video with English subtitles), however, the images speak for themselves. Furthermore, to the left of this paragraph you can find another report from Reuters, where Venezuelan homemaker Carmen Rondon
        explains how the cooking gas shortage forced her to cook with firewood.</p>
        <p>During the first months of 2020 the situation seemed to start getting better, however, as it is already happening with the fuel, it looks like the cooking gas shortage
        is going to attack again soon.</p>
        <p>This is a translated extract from a NTN24's <a href="https://www.ntn24.com/america-latina/venezuela/alertan-sobre-posible-escasez-de-gas-domestico-en-toda-venezuela-122184" target="_blank">report</a>, published on May 18, 2020:
        <span class="italic bold">"The Executive Director of the Unitary Federation of Oil Workers of Venezuela (FUTPV), Eudis Girot, warned of a possible shortage of domestic gas in the event of a plant stoppage that supplies the entire country.
        In his twitter account, Girot assured that there is no gas in the state oil company (PDVSA)"</span>.</p>
