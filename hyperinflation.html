        <p>Imagine that today you go to a convenience store near your house to buy some snacks, maybe you want to eat them while watching a movie or TV show
        with your family during the evening. You spent 2 dollars on them. The next day you go to the same convenience store to buy <span class="italic bold">the exact same products</span>,
        however this time you spent 3 dollars on them. The next day, 4 dollars, the next day, 5 dollars, so on and so forth, until you decide to stop buying them because
        such products have become a luxury for you, you can't afford them anymore.</p>

        <p>This is a simple example of how is to live under an hyperinflationary economy like Venezuela's, where by January 2020 <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-01-11/venezuela-s-maduro-starts-year-with-a-67-minimum-wage-hike"
        target="_blank">the minimum wage would pay for less than 1 kilogram of beef</a>. Recently, since May 1, 2020,
        <a href="https://www.politicalhispanic.com/en/venezuela-socialism-comunism/" target="_blank">the new minimum wage totalizes aproximately 4.66$</a>. Bear in mind though, that
        those 4.66$ include 2.33$ that correspond to meal allowance, so the base salary for someone who earns a minimum wage, is actually 2.33$.</p>
        <p>But how do Venezuelans survive? Might the reader ask.</p>
        <p>By November 2019, more than <a href="https://www.thenewhumanitarian.org/news/2019/11/21/Venezuela-migrants-visa-restrictions-Colombia" target="_blank">
        4.5 million Venezuelans had emigrated around the globe</a>. Most of those Venezuelans, like me, send money home, so that their families can survive. However, not everyone in Venezuela
        have a family member abroad. Many are dying of hunger, and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/feb/12/venezuela-crisis-babies-die-malnutrition-depression-deprivation-infant-mortality" target="_blank">
        babies are dying of malnutrition.</a></p>
